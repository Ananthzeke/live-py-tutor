# Python Tutor Live progamming Mode - Backed by Pyodide

This project is a modified version of Python tutor live programming mode by @pgbovine and inspired by https://cs320.cs.wisc.edu/pythontutor/live.html#mode=edit in the usage of pyodide.

## Features of Python Tutor
- Step by step visualization.
- Visualize different data structures like `list`, `tuple`, `dict` and `set`.
- Good debugging interface and execution stops at the error.
- Move back and forth through the execution.
- Different pointer modes like inline primitives, nested object, render everything in heap

## Live Programming mode
In the live programming mode the outputs are computed as you type

## Perks of Pyodide(powered by wasm)
- Everthing runs on your browser
- Lower latency and faster execution.

## Additional features
- Added support for a input cell for standard input.
- Modified support for permanent link generation(sharable) - added inputs to be also encoded with the permanent link
